The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.
The problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.",Multivariate,Health and Medicine,"Classification, Clustering","Categorical, Integer",101766,47

The input features consist of 11 common indices including volume of dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance (see details in dataset). The output to predict is the measurement of 'pH, water, unfiltered, field, standard units (Median)'.

There are two major water systems to consider: one is centered on the city of Atlanta while the other is centered on the eastern coast of Georgia. This information indicates spatial dependency among different locations which are important to the forecast.

Glioma Grading Clinical and Mutation Features,12/13/2022,"Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the brain. They can be graded as LGG (Lower-Grade Glioma) or GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) depending on the histological/imaging criteria. Clinical and molecular/mutation factors are also very crucial for the grading process. Molecular tests are expensive to help accurately diagnose glioma patients.    In this dataset, the most frequently mutated 20 genes and 3 clinical features are considered from TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM brain glioma projects.  The prediction task is to determine whether a patient is LGG or GBM with a given clinical and molecular/mutation features. The main objective is to find the optimal subset of mutation genes and clinical features for the glioma grading process to improve performance and reduce costs.","Tabular, Multivariate",Health and Medicine,"Classification, Other","Real, Categorical, Integer",839,23

Large-scale Wave Energy Farm,9/16/2023,"Wave energy is a rapidly advancing and promising renewable energy source that holds great potential for addressing the challenges of global warming and climate change. However, optimizing energy output in large wave farms presents a complex problem due to the expensive calculations required to account for hydrodynamic interactions between wave energy converters (WECs). Developing a fast and accurate surrogate model is crucial to overcome these challenges. In light of this, we have compiled an extensive WEC dataset that includes 54,000 and 9,600 configurations involving 49 and 100 WECs, coordination, power, q-factor, and total farm power output.

The prediction task is to determine whether a patient survived or is deceased at a time of about 9 days after collecting their medical record at the hospital.

This is an important prediction problem in clinical medicine. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by an immune overreaction to infection, leading to organ failure or even death. Sepsis is associated with immediate death risk, often killing patients within one hour. This renders many laboratory tests and hospital analyses impractical for timely diagnosis and treatment.
